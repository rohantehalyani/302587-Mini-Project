# Requirements

## Introduction
* This program is to provide easy solution for the conversion of different numeric conversion 
* The solution is to use algorithum which give fast conversion between data types
 1. Decimal to binary
 2. binary to Decimal
 3. Decimal to Hexadecial
 4. Hexadecial to Decimal
 5. Decimal to Octal
 6. Octal to Decimal

## Research
 For conversion of a simple decimal to binary we have used conventional method 
  
 1. Divide the number by 2.
 2. Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
 3. Get the remainder for the binary digit.
 4. Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0.
